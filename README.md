# Full Stack MERN APP - Kiran Nair

# What is it?
I used the MERN stack to write a Single Page Application (SPA) that tracks exercises completed by the user. I used React for the front-end UI app. I wrote a REST API using Node and Express for the back-end web service. And finally I will be using MongoDB for persistence.

# How to launch?
Essentially both folders require the node modules so in the terminal after changing the directory to the desired file (e.g. cd nameoffile), you will need to go ahead and do npm install and npm start for both folders.

# How does it work?
Essentially this web application is designed for you to keep track of specific workout exercises at the gym for e.g. Squats, Deadlifts etc. You can add a If you have made a successful exercise entry, it will alert that the creation of the exercise is successful and will divert you back to the original website to show that your exercise has been logged. In case you type a wrong entry, you can click the edit icon which will allow you edit. Similarly for the delete in case you want to delete an workout entry.
