# Full Stack MERN APP - Kiran Nair

# What is it?
I will use the MERN stack to write a Single Page Application (SPA) that tracks exercises completed by the user. I used React for the front-end UI app. I wrote a REST API using Node and Express for the back-end web service. And finally I will be using MongoDB for persistence.

# How to launch?
Essentially both folders require the node modules so in the terminal after changing the directory to the desired file (e.g. cd nameofile), you will need to go ahead and do npm install and npm start for both folders.
